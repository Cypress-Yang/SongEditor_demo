[verse] I know that I shouldn't want to change you.But it's like we're so dn far apart.And I'm pretty sure that I still love you.It doesn't mean I can't break your heart.So maybe there's just something wrong with me.I'm in and out of love too easily , <b>[chorus] just for tonight. I'm gonna lay with you until we close our eyes.Try to remember when we'd stay awake all night.My hands on your body can we please go back in time , [verse] I know that you think I like to argue.Well maybe you're right and enough to blame.</b> But I'm pretty sure that I adore you.But it's not the infatuation phase.So maybe there's just something wrong with me.I'm in and out of love so easily
