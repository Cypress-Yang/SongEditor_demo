[verse] Remember the rain. near and far beloved. Each drop a blessing from heavens above. And how as time flowed on those waters became one. Streams rivers and lakes. Reaching for the horizon and far beyond. They carry onward however changed with each brief reflection. by setting sun. By storm's wake Til welcomed home to gentle sea, [chorus] Sinking deeper and deeper in calm embrace. Loving tides sweep in and bear you down. Should you meet a soul rising surface-ways. With your unbeating heart wish them well
