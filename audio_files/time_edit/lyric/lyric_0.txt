[verse] You ooh. You ooh. Yeah. you know, [chorus] You know you know I've always needed you.You know you know. I really really miss you. What if I closed my eyes and drifted til forever to find you, <b>[verse] What if I stop seeing.The parts of you that live within me.What if I stop feeling.The strength that you'd insist is in me.My deepest fears might all come true.But I will try to keep my cool. Long as I keep breathing.I'll do my best to be like you. They say that time will mend.Any kind of aching heart.But I still wonder when.The healing will begin,</b> [chorus] You know you know. I've always needed you.You know you know. I really really miss you.What if I closed my eyes and drifted til forever to find you.Would you be looking for me too.Would you be looking for me too.What if I closed my eyes and drifted til forever to find you.
